# Ecobuilder üó∫Ô∏è

## Current


## To Download
This is a unity 2021.3.10f1 project. Currently, there is no release. 

## Purpose
This was orignally a school assignment, but I incorperated a long standing idea into it. My goal was to make distributed system and, more specifically, an ecosystem of entities. Even after the class is done, I plan to continue to use it as a learning oppurtunity. 

## Benefits
So far, I have learned much about Unity. In particular, I learned a great deal about how to write more efficient unity code, how to serialize objects effectively, and how to connect to a network. More broadly, I was able to grasp more about creating an efficient system architecture and got practice in utilizing messaging systems and observer patterns. I was able to create an interconnected ecoystem that was enabled dynamic creation and delation upon clients joining and their spawning entities. 

## Status
This project is finished for school. I will take a hiatus, but I do plan to update it periodically in the future.
