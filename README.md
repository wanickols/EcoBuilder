## Current


## To Download
This is a unity 2021.3.10f1 project. Currently, there is no release. 

## Purpose
This was orignally a school assignment. My goal was to make distributed system. After the semester is over, I plan to expand this to continue to learn unity as well as for fun.

## Benefits
So far, I have learned much about Unity. In particular, I learned a great deal about how to write more efficient unity code, how to serialize objects effectively, and how to connect to a network.

## Status
This project is finished for school. I will take a short hiatus, but I do plan to update it periodically in the future.
